## Server-side Component Installation


*Spell checking* and *image tools proxy* require the deployment of several server-side components onto a J2EE compatible application server.  We currently support Jetty, Apache Tomcat, and WebSphere Application Server.  To discuss support for additional Java application servers, please contact us: <mailto:sales@ephox.com>

The following server-side components are packaged with the TinyMCE SDK:

|Component                      | File							| Description |
|:-----------------------------	|:-------						|:----------- |
| Allowed Origins				| ephox-allowed-origins.war 	| Supplies configuration for server components to communicate with your application. In order to use the *Spellchecking* or *Image Tools Proxy* features, you **must** install and configure this component.|
| [Spellchecking]({{ site.baseurl }}/enterprise/check-spelling/) 				| ephox-spelling.war		|Spell checking service for TinyMCE Enterprise.|
| [Image Tools Proxy]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/imagetools/)				| ephox-image-proxy.war		|Image proxy service for the Image Tools plugin.|
| Hyperlink Checking				| ephox-hyperlinking.war		| Hyperlink validity checking service. |


This guide will help you set up the server-side components for the above-mentioned features, and show you how to use them in conjunction with editor clients. The steps required are:

1. Install a Java application server (or use existing)
2. Deploy server-side components
3. Create a configuration file and configure the allowed origins service
4. Pass the configuration file to the Java application server
5. Restart the Java application server
6. Set up editor client instances to use the server-side functionality


### Step 1. Install a Java Application Server

Server-side components require a Java Application Server to run.

If you don't already have a Java application server installed you can easily install [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) with their default settings.

These are both simple, open source Java application servers and they're easy to install and configure.  The editor SDK supports both of these platforms. For the later setup, it's also helpful if you note any domain name and port number you specify during installation of the web application server.

> **Memory requirement:** Please ensure that you configure your Java Server (Tomcat/Jetty etc) with a minimum of 4GB. Please refer to the Out of Memory Services Troubleshooting page if you require instructions on how to explicitly define how much RAM will be allocated to your Java server.


### Step 2. Deploy Server-side Components

You’ll need to ensure you deploy the following WAR files packaged with the TinyMCE Enterprise SDK:

- ephox-allowed-origins.war
- ephox-spelling.war
- ephox-image-proxy.war
- ephox-hyperlinking.war

The easiest way to deploy these files is to simply drag and drop them into the webapps directory of your Tomcat/Jetty server (or equivalent folder of another Java application server), and then restart the server.

More information on deploying components/applications:

- [Deploying applications with Tomcat 6.0](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/deployer-howto.html)
- [Deploying applications with Jetty](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Deploy_Web_Applications)


### Step 3. Create a configuration file and configure the allowed origins service

> **Note:** It is recommended that you use a plain text editor (eg: gedit, vim, emacs, notepad etc) when creating or editing the application.conf file. Do not use editors like Evernote as there is a good chance of smart quotes being used where plain quotes should be used and this will cause the services to fail.

Services require a configuration file named `application.conf` to be referenced by the application server.

The allowed-origins configuration element will need to be specified in order for the other server-side components to work.
It includes the following two pieces of information:

- `origins` - which domains are allowed to communicate with the server-side editor features.
- `url` - the location of the allowed-origins checking service itself.

#### allowed-origins

This element configures the allowed-origins service which allows all server-side components to communicate with specified domains.

The `origins` attribute must list all the domains that instances of the editor will be hosted on.  Only requests from the listed origins will be processed by the server-side components. Requests from any other domains will be rejected. An array of strings representing the domains allowed to communicate with the services.

> Note: Be sure to include the protocol (https or http) and any required port number (eg:8080) in the string.

The `url` attribute defines the location of the allowed-origins service. This string is a concatenation of two values:

- String 1: The URL location of the allowed-origins service
- String 2: The API to access in the service (/cors).

Example:

````
ephox {
	allowed-origins {
		origins = [ "http://myserver", "http://myserver:8080", "http://myotherserver", "http://myotherserver:9090", "https://mysecureserver" ]
		url = "http://myserver:8080/ephox-allowed-origins/cors"
	}
}
````

##### Additional Information Around Entering Origins

The origins are matched by protocol, host name, and port. So you may need a combination of all three, depending on which browsers you use. If you are serving the editor and services from `http://localhost` & port 80, then the list of origins should have an entry for `http://localhost` and any other servers with ports, like so:

````
ephox{
   allowed-origins{
	   origins=["http://localhost", "http://any-other-servers:port"]
	   url = "http://localhost/ephox-allowed-origins/cors"
  }
}
````

This only applies to port 80 because this being the default HTTP port, browsers omit it when talking to the server. For every other port and host name, the recommended setting is to make one entry with the port and one without the port. This is because different browsers behave differently with regards to the Origin header. So the config file should resemble:

````
ephox{
   allowed-origins{
	   origins=["http://hostname", "http://hostname:1234"]
	   url = "http://hostname:1234/ephox-allowed-origins/cors"
  }
}
````

Ensure that you have the right protocol specified, and for more examples see the section below. If you experience issues, please use the Troubleshooting guide (in the Tip below) and you should be able to see if the browser sends a different origin to the one that you have specified. Both must match for the services to work.

##### Troubleshooting Origins

Depending on your configuration and the browser you use, you may need to specify the port number as well when listing the origin. If you observe that requests are failing with services not being available, it may be because the port number is required. Refer to troubleshooting guide - section titled Investigating Using the Browser's Network Tools.

##### Example application.conf

TinyMCE is deployed to an environment and displayed to end users on the following domains:

- http://myCMS
- https://myCMS
- http://myCMS:4141

The `allowed-origins` service has been installed and is accessible via the following URL:

- http://myCMS:8080/ephox-allowed-origins

For this example, here is what the contents of `application.conf` should look like:

````
ephox{
   allowed-origins{
           origins=["http://myCMS", "https://myCMS", "http://myCMS:4141"]
           url = "http://myCMS:8080/ephox-allowed-origins/cors"
  }
}
````

#### link-checking.cache (optional)

This element configures the hyperlinking service's built-in cache. When a hyperlink is checked and confirmed valid, the result is cached to save unnecessary network traffic in the future.

Default settings are automatically configured, meaning these settings optional.

The `capacity` attribute sets the capacity of the cache. The default setting is 500.

The `timeToLiveInSeconds` attribute sets the time-to-live of elements of the cache, measured in seconds. This is the maximum total amount of time that an element is allowed to remain in the cache. The default setting is 86400 seconds, which is one day.

The `timeToIdleInSeconds` attribute sets the time-to-idle of elements of the cache, measured in seconds. This is the maximum amount of time that an element will remain in the cache if it is not being accessed. The default setting is 3600 seconds, which is one hour.

````
ephox {
    link-checking.cache {
        capacity = 500
        timeToLiveInSeconds = 86400
        timeToIdleInSeconds = 3600
    }
}
````

### Step 4. Pass the configuration file to the Java application server

You’ll need to reference the configuration file created in Step 3 as a parameter passed to the JVM running the services. Once the server has been configured to use the file, restart the server.

> **Note:** If the path to your application.conf file has spaces in it, you must ensure you prefix each white space with an escape character (\). Example: ` -Dconfig.file=/config/file/location/with/white\ space/application.conf`

The following examples demonstrate how to reference application.conf for Tomcat or Jetty instances.


#### Tomcat Unix example:

Make/edit a script at `/tomcat/install/directory/bin/setenv.sh`

Ensure the file contains a single line, like (this must be the absolute path as before):

`CATALINA_OPTS=" -Dconfig.file=/config/file/location/application.conf"`


#### Tomcat (Windows) example:

Make/edit a script at `DRIVE:\tomcat\install\directory\bin\setenv.bat`

The file should contain a single line:

`set CATALINA_OPTS= -Dconfig.file=DRIVE:\config\file\location\application.conf`


#### Jetty (simple configuration):

You can specify your `application.conf` as a parameter to this command, along with other JVM parameters:

`java -jar /jetty/install/directory/start.jar -Dconfig.file="/config/file/location/application.conf"`


#### Jetty (automatic configuration for services launching on system start-up):

Edit `/etc/default/jetty` and add the line:

`JETTY_OPTS=" -Dconfig.file=/config/file/location/application.conf"`

Edit `/opt/jetty/start.ini` and add the line:

`" -Dconfig.file=/config/file/location/application.conf"`

The first new lines of the file should read:

````
#===========================================================
# Jetty start.jar arguments
# Each line of this file is prepended to the command line
# arguments # of a call to:
# java -jar start.jar [arg...]
#===========================================================
" -Dconfig.file=/config/file/location/application.conf"
````


### Step 5: Restart the Java application server

Once you have created a configuration file, configured the allowed origins service, and passed the configuration file to the Java application server you must restart the Java application server.

### Step 6: Set up editor client instances to use the server-side functionality

With the above steps completed you can now direct TinyMCE instances to use the image editing and server-side spelling components.

Set the TinyMCE `spellchecker_rpc_url` configuration property to the URL of the deployed server side spelling component. This URL is provided to you by your Java application server.
Set the TinyMCE `imagetools_proxy` configuration property to the URL of the deployed server-side image proxy component.

Example of TinyMCE client configuration:

````
tinymce.init({
	selector: 'textarea', // change this value according to your HTML
	toolbar: 'image',
	plugins: 'tinymcespellchecker image imagetools',
	spellchecker_rpc_url: 'http://yourspelling.server.com/ephox-spelling/',
	imagetools_proxy: 'http://yourproxy.server.com/ephox-image-proxy/image'
});
````


### Logging

For compartmentalization of logs in your environment or to provide Ephox with more succinct feedback around the behavior of your deployed TinyMCE Spelling Component (e.g. for support purposes), you may want to write out the spelling-service specific logs to a specific file.

To write the spelling-service specific logs to a specific file, you’ll need to perform the following steps:

#### Create a logging configuration XML file

The spelling service uses the [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) logging format.

For easy implementation, here is a sample XML configuration with a tokenized value you can populate where {$LOG_LOCATION} is the location and name of the file you would like to write the logs to (e.g. /tmp/tinymce_services.log).

````
<configuration>

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
	<encoder>
	  <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
	</encoder>
  </appender>

  <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
	<file>{$LOG_LOCATION}</file>
	<encoder>
	  <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
	</encoder>
  </appender>

  <!-- This results in all ephox logging going to file.
	   Change/uncomment this part here if spellchecking specific logging is required -->
  <logger name="com.ephox" level="INFO"/>
  <!-- <logger name="com.ephox.ironbark" level="INFO"/> -->

  <root level="INFO">
	<appender-ref ref="FILE" />
	<!-- If you want logging to go to the container as well uncomment
	the following line -->
	<!-- <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" /> -->
  </root>

</configuration>
````

#### Add the logging configuration to your classpath

Much like how your `application.conf` services configuration file is added to the classpath (see Step 3 above), you’ll need to follow a similar pattern to add your logging configuration XML to the classpath.

````
-Dlogback.configurationFile={$LOG_LOCATION}
````
